# LinkedList-Singly
# Singly Linked List Implementation in Java
This project contains a simple implementation of a singly linked list in Java with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and display.

Features
* Insert at Beginning: Add a new node at the start of the list.
* Delete at Beginning: Remove the first node of the list.
* Insert at End: Add a new node at the end of the list.
* Delete at End: Remove the last node of the list.
* Display List: Print all elements of the linked list.
  
Code Overview
The class linkedlist_singly contains an inner Node class representing each element in the list. The main class manages the head pointer and provides methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Key Methods
* insertAtBegin(int data)
Inserts a new node with the given data at the beginning of the list.

* deleteAtBeginning()
Deletes the node at the beginning of the list. If the list is empty, it prints an appropriate message.

* insertAtEnd(int data)
Inserts a new node with the given data at the end of the list.

* deleteAtEnd()
Deletes the node at the end of the list. If the list is empty, it prints an appropriate message.

* display()
Prints the current elements of the list in order, ending with null.
